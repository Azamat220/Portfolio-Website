Project Title: Building a Comprehensive Portfolio Website

Project Description:

In this project, you will create a comprehensive portfolio website that showcases your skills, creativity, and understanding of web development, while excluding media queries. The website should include various sections, including an introduction, an about page, a resume, a works section, a gallery, and contact information. Your goal is to implement responsive design, use CSS layout techniques, and create an aesthetically pleasing and functional website.

Project Tasks:

Project Setup and GitHub: Set up a GitHub repository for your project. Ensure you have a clear directory structure for your HTML, CSS, and any JavaScript files. Your project should be version-controlled using Git.

HTML Structure: Create an organized HTML structure for your portfolio website. Consider using HTML5 semantic elements where appropriate. Create the following sections:

Home (Welcome Page): A visually appealing landing page that welcomes visitors to your portfolio. Include a prominent heading, a brief introduction, and possibly a background image or illustration.

About: Write a comprehensive "About Me" section. Include information about yourself, your background, skills, interests, and any relevant personal details.

Resume: Design a web-based CV (resume). Include sections for your education, work experience, skills, and any other relevant details. You can format this like a traditional CV but with a web design twist.

Works: Showcase your HTML and CSS projects that you've worked on during the course. Include descriptions and possibly links to the projects if available.

Gallery: Create a gallery section where you can display your personal photos or artwork. Use a grid layout or Flexbox to arrange the gallery items.

Contact: Include your contact information, such as phone number, email, and links to your social media profiles (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn). Make it easy for visitors to get in touch with you.

CSS Styling: Apply CSS styles to your portfolio website. Use what you've learned in the CSS modules to create a visually appealing design. Pay attention to typography, color schemes, spacing, and visual consistency.

CSS Layout Techniques: Utilize Flexbox to create flexible and visually appealing layouts for your sections. For example, you can use Flexbox for aligning items in the header, arranging your CV sections, and displaying your gallery.

Navigation: Implement a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between the different sections of your website. Consider using CSS transitions or other animations to enhance user experience.

Interactivity (Optional): If you want to challenge yourself further, consider adding interactive features using JavaScript. For example, you can create a contact form that users can fill out, or you can implement smooth scrolling to navigate between sections.

Testing: Thoroughly test your portfolio website on different devices and web browsers. Ensure it's free of any layout issues or bugs.

Documentation: Provide a detailed README file in your GitHub repository. Explain the purpose of your portfolio, the technologies used, and any special features you've added. Include instructions for viewing your portfolio on GitHub Pages.

Project Submission:

Submit your project by providing the GitHub Pages link to your portfolio website. Ensure that your GitHub repository contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and any JavaScript files. Additionally, provide a README file that explains your project and its features.

This modified project focuses on building a comprehensive portfolio website without media queries, emphasizing the core concepts covered in the first eight weeks. It's a practical exercise in web development and design that will help students showcase their skills.
